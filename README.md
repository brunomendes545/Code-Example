# Code-Example

This is a simple public code repository to give examples of where I used different programming tools as evidence of my programming skills.
In the first example, I use R and QMD to do some visualizations, data analysis, and LaTeX.
In the second example, I use STATA for a microeconometric analysis.
In the last example, I give the link for my R package and a Shiny app with it.
